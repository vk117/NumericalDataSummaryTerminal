# Numerical Data Summary Terminal

How to Run the Program
--------------------------

1) Place the jar file in a folder.

2) Create an empty text file and name it "null.txt" and place it in the same folder.

3) Using a terminal (or cmd) navigate to the aforementioned folder.

4) Type the command java -jar NumericalDataSummaryTerminal.jar

Important
----------
- If you start the program with a terminal or command prompt window that is not full screen, the title text gets jumbled. This does not affect the performance of the program, it simply makes the title text look bad.

- If you run the "file" command and you cannot find the file dialog window, minimize your terminal. It should be underneath.

Future Plans
------------

- A GUI so that the program does not have to be run on your computer's console.

- Graph support, namely histograms and box plots.
