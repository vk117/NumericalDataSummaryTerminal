# Numerical Data Summary Terminal

How to Run the Program
--------------------------

1) Place the jar file in a folder.

2) Create an empty text file and name it "null.txt" and place it in the same folder.

3) Using a terminal (or cmd) navigate to the aforementioned folder.

4) Type the command java -jar NumericalDataSummaryTerminal.jar

Important
----------
- If you start the program with a terminal or command prompt window that is not full screen, the title text gets jumbled. This does not affect the performance of the program, it simply makes the title text look bad.

- If you run the "file" command and you cannot find the file dialog window, minimize your terminal. It should be underneath.

- The list of numbers in the text files that you select can be punctuated with spaces or commas. However, if you choose to add commas, make sure that there are spaces between the commas and numbers (e.g. 5 , 2 , 8 , 1). If not, the program will not read numbers with commas attached. 

- The "null.txt" file is an empty file that is necessary for the program to function properly. It was not added by mistake. 

Future Plans
------------

- GUI

- Graph support, namely histograms and box plots.
